# grains2

grains2 enables modeling of thermal emission and ice sublimation in cometary comae.

WARNING: Thermal emission code is not well tested.  The temperature calculations are good, but the spectroscopic results have not been verified.

Ice sublimation code is good.

Bohren and Huffman Mie and coated sphere code from Bruce Draine https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~draine/scattering.html  See source code for improvements on the original BH code.
